This repositiry is for some of my NLP-LLM projects with Python basically showing some skills using: Transformer Hugging Face, PyTorch, TensorFlow, RAG implementation, LangChain, ChromaDB, focusing on fine tuning and a bit of evaluation. Everything is inside Google Colab notebooks in case of using Colab's GPU for faster development. Easy to open in Colab or run locally.
